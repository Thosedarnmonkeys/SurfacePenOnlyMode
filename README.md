# SurfacePenOnlyMode
A pen only mode for the Microsoft Surface

This is a little utility to disable touch on the Surface Pro 4 screen, while keeping pen functionality intact.
It works by disabling the relevant HID driver, which can be seen in the device manager.

Currently only being develeoped for the Surface Pro 4, but if there is interest, for older models too.

NOTE: App must be run as Administrator to have sufficient permissions.
